Since you found this website, you most likely already know about stenography and its tiny but awesome amateur community that had built the last few years.

If not, here are some pointers:

* [Open Steno Project](http://www.openstenoproject.org/)
* [Learn Plover!](https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc/home)
* [Plover Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/0lQde43a6dGmAMp2)
* [Plover Theory](https://morinted.gitbooks.io/plover-theory/)

While trying to optimize my typing, I stumbled upon Open Steno and fell in love with both the idea and the community.
Have a look at my [Hello World!](https://stenoblog.com/hello-world/) post if you want to know more about how this all started for me.

My name is [Martin](https://mkoerner.de) and I'm a software engineer from Germany.
