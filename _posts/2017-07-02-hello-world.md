Hello everyone! This post marks the very beginning -- well, actually prior to the beginning -- of my stenography journey.

It all started similar to many of the stories that I've read.
Being disappointed with the efficiency of QWERTY keyboards, I was looking into alternatives.
After spending quite some time comparing [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard), [Colemak](https://colemak.com/), and friends, I decided to learn the Colemak layout.
The main reason was its [xkb](https://www.x.org/wiki/XKB/) support together with the fact that, with one exception, only letters were replaced.
I'm programming a lot and I don't like the positioning of braces and brackets on Dvorak.

So here I was, reconfiguring [i3](http://i3wm.org/), my window manager, to handle the new layout while learning Colemak with [keybr.com](http://www.keybr.com/).
At some point, I stumbled upon [Epistory](http://www.epistorygame.com/), a RPG-style game in which you play a girl riding a three-tailed fox and fight against monsters.
By typing words.
I was super interested in this game and couldn't wait to play it.
While browsing the Steam store, I also noticed [Steno Arcade](http://www.foralltoplay.com/games/steno-arcade/index.php).
I got curious about the "steno" part.
Naturally, this led me to the [Open Steno Project](http://www.openstenoproject.org/) pretty quickly.
The [Plover: Thought to Text at 240 WPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpv-Qb-dB6g) video by [Mirabai Knight](http://stenoknight.com/) was all it took to get me hooked.
On the same day I decided to order a steno keyboard.
After getting to know the options and doing some reading, a [review](http://www.tedmor.in/blog/posts/stenomod-affordable-steno-machine) by [Ted Morin](http://www.tedmor.in/), the lead developer of [Plover](http://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/), convinced me.
[Stenomod](https://stenomod.blogspot.de/) it is.
[Charley](https://plus.google.com/107156479981746619145), the man behind the Stenomod, was super friendly and sent out the package on the next day.
I went for 
"[the Hinge](https://stenomod.blogspot.de/2017/06/a-new-option.html)", a version where the two halves of the keyboard are held together with a door hinge instead of being screwed on top of a wood deck.

And this is where we are now.
Waiting for the package to arrive.

In the meanwhile, I installed the latest version of Plover thanks to the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plover-git) and [support](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/issues/785) of Benoit Pierre.
The [Stenography for Programming](http://www.fortressofdoors.com/stenography-for-programming/) blog article and [steno diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzpb_xWfiXzUo3f1jHkmLVb0pOB7py6gwL0XHyCYewA/edit) by [Lars Doucet](https://twitter.com/larsiusprime) inspired me to also share my experiences.

The next post will be about my first impressions of the Stenomod and, well, stenography in general.
